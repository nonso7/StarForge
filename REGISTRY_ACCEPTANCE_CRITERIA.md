- [ ] Test with invalid ZIP files
- [ ] Test rating system with multiple users
- [ ] Test web UI on different browsers

### Automated Testing

```bash
cd registry-api
npm test
```

Should pass all test suites:

- Template publishing tests
- Search tests
- Review/rating tests
- Error handling tests

### Integration Testing

1. Full workflow from CLI:
   - Signup account
   - Publish template
   - Search for template
   - Install template
   - Rate template

2. Full workflow from web UI:
   - Browse templates
   - Login/signup
   - View ratings and reviews

3. Conflict handling:
   - Duplicate publication
   - Invalid metadata
   - Missing files

## Performance Criteria

- [ ] Search results return within 500ms
- [ ] Template download completes within 30s (for typical 10MB)

- [ ] JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- [ ] ZIP files validated before storage
- [ ] File uploads limited to 50MB
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (N/A for current in-memory, but ready for MongoDB)

## Sign-Off

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Notes

- Current implementation uses in-memory stores; MongoDB integration ready for production
- Rate limiting recommended before production deployment
- Consider CDN for template file downloads in future phases
- Email verification recommended for production (currently not implemented)
- Two-factor authentication recommended for security-conscious users
