- [x] **Keypair generation < 10ms**: Near-instant
  - Test: Click generate 10 times, measure time
  - Expected: All complete in <10ms each

- [x] **Hashing < 5ms**: SHA256 completes quickly
  - Test: Hash large string (1MB)
  - Expected: Completes in <5ms

- [x] **UI responsive**: No blocking operations
  - Test: Generate keypair, UI stays responsive
  - Expected: Can click other buttons immediately

- [x] **Memory efficient**: WASM module loads under 10MB
  - Test: Check DevTools > Memory
  - Expected: WASM heap < 10MB

- [x] **Startup time < 1s**: Page loads and initializes quickly
  - Test: Load page, measure time to interactive
  - Expected: < 1 second
